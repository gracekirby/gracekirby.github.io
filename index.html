    The code that I used, was to create a website about skiing and Lindsey Vonn. 
    I tried to emphasize through elements like bold, strong, small, and more about how skiing is better than all the other snow sports. 
    I also included photos and videos of skiers to have the main idea of skiing featured the most as well as the sweet sounds of skiing.

        <h1>Why You Should Stop ‘Gamifying’ Your Health and Fitness</h1>
    </header>
<h4>You don't need to chase a fake goal to be able to chase a real goal.</h4>
<p>By <b>Beth Skwarecki</b></p>

<img src="fitness4.jpeg" atl="Runner">

<p>Whenever there’s a task you don’t want to do, there’s a guaranteed way to feel worse about it: Just add a whole layer of guilt and disappointment on top. Streaks that you’ll inevitably break, badges you don’t care about, check-in notifications that bug you when you were just trying to relax. Ahh, gamification.</p>

<p>Before we talk about all the reasons gamification is bullshit, let’s talk about why games work the way they do. In a roleplaying game, you earn “experience points” as a metaphor for real-life experience. You earn fake money because it’s meant to mimic the concept of real-life money. You’re given a quest because, in real life, people work hard in pursuit of goals. Games have these metrics and structures because the game is trying to imitate real life.</p>

<h3>Aim for consistency, not streaks</h3>

<p>Streaks entertain you during good times with the explicit goal of heaping disappointment on you when you slip up. And they’re a particularly harmful type of misdirection, because people easily become more focused on the streak than on whatever reason they were doing the streak in the first place.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Running a local 5K, and trying to finish in the top X percent of your age group.</li>
    <li>Competing in something like a powerlifting meet, where you try to put up the best possible total on meet day.</li>
    <li>Joining a recreational sports league, and getting to know the members of your softball/soccer/pickleball team while either crushing the competition or commiserating about your inability to do so.</li>
</ul>
