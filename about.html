<p id="bio">I was born and raised in the greater Seattle area and came to Boise in 2020 as a freshman ready to have new and exciting experiences! I am currently a Junior studying Communications and attaining a Digital Media Certificate and a Sports, Information and Culture Certificate at Boise State University. I am also involved in my sorority, Delta Delta Delta, where I am currently serving as the Vice President of Chapter Programming and Development. Because of my academic achievements, I am involved in the Order of Omega at Boise State, where I am serving on the cabinet as the Director of Marketing and Promotions.

    
    In October of 2022, I finished a six month internship program with Chillow App, a startup out of Boise that is an app to find roommates as well as places to live. Here I learned crucial skills about professionalism, communication, and content creation for clients.
    
    Currently, I am a part-time marketing intern at Inviso, a technology consulting firm based in Bellevue Washington. While being apart of Inviso, I have been able to help with creating content for their social media pages as well as helping with smaller tasks on projects for clients within Microsoft.
    
    When I am not studying, working, or talking about Greek Life, you can find me skiing on the closest mountain or out on a lake wake surfing! I am a huge Macklemore fanatic and love to take photos with my disposable camera!
    
    Once I graduate from Boise State University, I plan to head back home to the Seattle area and continue to work my way through the marketing industry. Being able to create content and work in a team to accomplish a project is something that I love to do and I am very excited to see where life takes me.</p>
